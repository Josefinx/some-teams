# some-teams

Welcome to Some-teams! This is my first project as a student web developer, where I created a simple website to display information about different soccer teams.

Project Overview
This project is a static website that showcases various soccer teams. Each team has it’s own card with details such as the team’s logo, city, current ranking etc. The goal of this project was to practice my PHP, HTML and CSS.

Usage
Visit the homepage to see an overview of the soccer teams.
Click the link to visit the team’s website to view more details.
